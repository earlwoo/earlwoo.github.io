Some tips and hints:

- Be friendly to EVERYONE.  (seretary, front desk, security, answering machines) - I've on many occasions asked staff what they were like when they weren't being interviewd by me.  thank yous and goodbyes to everyone who you interacted with, they might slip a comment to interviewer (an addition when deciding which candidate they want to hire and work with)

- Don't think of proper answers, they've been heard.  Be honest, truthful, and yourself(sugarcoat, and present yourself in good light) (character stands out, depending on the stage of interview, you've already qualified skills wise, or will be dealing with that another part of the interview)

- Envisioning working with that person was a heavy heavy consideration for me, especially thinking of how candidate would affect team composition (positive energy, neutral and negative vibe always was an immediate indicator of bad fit).  next would have been speculating potential, leadership/initiative, or eagerness/dedication

- Have fun with the interviewer, make appropriate neutral jokes, slip in hobbies (do they look like they'll enjoy..... or even mention something they might like (food, sports, fashion))

- Try to get them to talk (about themselves, how they feel about the job here and be genuinely curious)

- Thank them for the intervew, say something to end (i usually say i am usually nervous about interviews but I really enjoyed talking with you and it was very pleasurable)

- Really appreciate their time and their insight, make them feel they really cleared things up for you and it was a really important and productive experience

- follow up, not too often(thank you, then a week or 2 later)
